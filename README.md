Hello!! My name is Larissa, and I am trying to do something different during my college vacation.


Before I start explaining the results, I will explain what motivated me to do this. Since I was born, I have always watched soccer games, I usually say that I didn’t have the chance to choose my favorite team!! But I only watched women's soccer on television when I was nine, it was the Women’s World Cup in Germany, I never forgot this moment and my dad saying how much Marta was good!!


Since then, I have not stopped watching the Brazilian Women’s National Team. It used to be difficult because the media didn't cover it much, but things have improved in the last couple of years, especially after the 2019 World Cup. After that, I started watching more soccer games, both international and national games. My goal was to go to Australia to watch the Women’s World Cup, but since everything isn't perfect, I will watch the games at home and cheer a lot for Brazil to reach the finals.


Ok Lari, what does this history about soccer relate to this Git repository? Well ….. For those who don’t know on day 07-20-2024, will happen the Women’s World Cup in Australia/New Zealand. Last year I saw many programmers playing with soccer data to predict who would win the Qatar World Cup, and then I thought, “Why I don’t do the same thing, but for the Women’s World Cup?”. Well, after postponing this project, because of my college and my internship, I finally finished with some help from [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anEoBZkZRHA) and sites on the internet. 


In this prediction USA wins again, becoming five-time WWC champion!!! I was already expecting this result since the USA has had expressive numbers in competitions, and for a long time, they maintained hegemony over other teams. Butttt I wouldn’t say that they will be champions this year, and I will explain that.


Before my explanation, I would like to talk about the Poisson Method, it’s good, but doesn’t have accuracy. Maybe he works better when the data is better distributed over the years. When I used only World Cup data, this benefited the USA, since they won WWC four times. Then, I tried to insert data from other championships, that occur between the cups such as the America Cup, and BOOM!! Brazill is the winner!!! What I wanted right? Yes.. but this is serious. This result shows the Brazilian hegemony in South America. Adding data from Olimpyc games and EuroCup, the results started to make sense, but there is the Poisson problem, he is induced based on the data.

The result I was waiting for, came after adding data from Kaggle, based on EuroCup, Finalissima, and friendly games. 

Lari, why don’t you use IA? Everyone is using it! Yes, IA has been used a lot in the last couple of years, but now we see the importance of human analysis. I questioned ChatGPT about the winner, and what he said? Well, the USA will win again. But if we analyze women’s soccer in the last years, we see some points:      


  - USA has a new team, new players and new coach, and they don’t have big names like Christen Press, Tobin Heath and Mallory Pugh, because of injuries. 


  - Since 2019-2023, the England team has emerged as a dominant force in Europe. This is largely due to Sarina Wiegman coaching the national team. She is undoubtedly one of the best coaches in the world. However, the team is currently facing challenges with injuries. Key players such as Leah Williamson, Beth Mead, and Fran Kirby won't be able to participate in the upcoming Cup.


  - The Spain team can be one of the winners, because of Alexia Putellas and Aitana Bonmatí, big stars and great players who make the difference inside the field. In recent months, the national team has faced challenges due to issues with the coach. Some key players, such as Mapi and Patri, have opted not to participate in the Cup and have protested about their rights, which is completely understandable.


  - Brazillll, my country - every game that I watch makes me more confident about our team, especially since Pia Sundhage started training them.  In the 2019 World Cup, Brazil didn’t have a strong midfield and there wasn't a national game calendar. But when this woman started coaching this team, things changed. Now we can see new faces, a stronger team dynamic, and some players gaining recognition in the women's soccer scenario, Geyse, Kerolin, and Rafaelle!!


Well, I could talk about soccer all day long, making different analyses every day, but my goal here is to encourage people to watch women’s soccer. I hope I achieved that in you guys!
